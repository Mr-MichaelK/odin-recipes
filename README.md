# odin-recipes
The aim of this project is to practice what I have learned so far in the Odin Project HTML lessons in the foundations course.

Throughout the project I will be aiming to utilize as many HTML elements as I can remember to establish a bakery website titled "Mike's Bakery". 

In this website I will showcase what foods the bakery offers, their ingredients, the secret recipe that the baker (Mike) begged me not to share.
