    <h1>Zaatar:</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Zaatar falls into the category of "Man'ooshe", 
        which is a baked dough covered by a seasoning of your choice. <br>
    Zaatar, which is arabic for thyme, is the 
        main ingredient of our people's favorite Man'ooshe, hence why it gets the name.
    </p>
